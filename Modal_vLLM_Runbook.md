# Modal and vLLM Runbook

## Companion Guide for InferTutor Arena

This document explains the infrastructure used in the capstone. It is intentionally detailed so that setup does not become the bottleneck.

## What Is Modal?

Modal is a serverless compute platform for running Python functions on CPUs and GPUs. For this assignment, Modal gives us:

- On-demand H100 GPU containers.
- Persistent volumes for Hugging Face and vLLM caches.
- Secrets for storing Hugging Face tokens.
- Secrets for storing the endpoint bearer token used by the benchmark client.
- A public HTTPS endpoint for the vLLM server.
- Replica scaling through `min_containers` and `max_containers`.
- Per-second billing, which is useful for short experiments.

In this capstone, your laptop runs the load tester. Modal runs the GPU-backed vLLM server.

## What Is vLLM?

vLLM is an inference engine for serving large language models efficiently. It provides:

- OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.
- Continuous batching.
- PagedAttention.
- Prefix caching.
- Chunked prefill.
- Tensor parallelism.
- CUDA graph / compilation support for some workloads.
- Multimodal support for models such as Qwen-VL.

The assignment uses vLLM as a production-style serving engine. You are not calling `model.generate()` in a notebook. You are running a server and measuring it under concurrent load.

## Setup Checklist

### 1. Install local dependencies

Use Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r starter_code/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Authenticate Modal

If you have never used Modal:

```bash
modal token new
```

If your instructor gives you a Modal token id and secret:

```bash
modal token set --token-id <TOKEN_ID> --token-secret <TOKEN_SECRET>
```

Check that it works:

```bash
modal token info
```

### 3. Create Hugging Face secret

The vLLM container needs a Hugging Face token to download the model.

```bash
modal secret create huggingface HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>
```

The starter app expects the secret name to be:

```text
huggingface
```

### 4. Create endpoint auth secret

The authenticated vLLM server also requires a bearer token shared with the local benchmark client:

```bash
modal secret create infertutor-auth ENDPOINT_API_KEY=<YOUR_ENDPOINT_API_KEY>
export ENDPOINT_API_KEY=<YOUR_ENDPOINT_API_KEY>
```

The starter app expects the auth secret name to be:

```text
infertutor-auth
```

### 5. Run a smoke test

Start small:

```bash
python run_infertutor_experiment.py \
  --label smoke \
  --gpu-type H100 \
  --replicas 1 \
  --mode text \
  --users 5 \
  --duration 30 \
  --ramp-up 5 \
  --max-tokens 64
```

If this passes with zero errors, your infrastructure is working. The runner now validates both `/health` and a real authenticated `/v1/chat/completions` request before load starts.

## Main Commands

### Single-GPU baseline

```bash
python run_infertutor_experiment.py \
  --label baseline-text \
  --gpu-type H100 \
  --replicas 1 \
  --max-seqs 32 \
  --max-batch-tokens 4096 \
  --mode text \
  --users 50 \
  --duration 60 \
  --ramp-up 15 \
  --max-tokens 96
```

### Multimodal product baseline

```bash
python run_infertutor_experiment.py \
  --label mixed-r2 \
  --gpu-type H100 \
  --replicas 2 \
  --max-seqs 32 \
  --max-batch-tokens 4096 \
  --mode mixed \
  --users 100 \
  --duration 90 \
  --ramp-up 25 \
  --max-tokens 96
```

### Text speed baseline with compiled mode

```bash
python run_infertutor_experiment.py \
  --label compiled-r4 \
  --gpu-type H100 \
  --replicas 4 \
  --no-fast-boot \
  --max-seqs 32 \
  --max-batch-tokens 4096 \
  --mode text \
  --users 400 \
  --duration 90 \
  --ramp-up 40 \
  --max-tokens 96
```

`--no-fast-boot` disables eager mode. Startup takes longer, but text throughput can improve substantially after vLLM compiles and captures CUDA graphs.

## Important vLLM Knobs

### `--max-seqs`

Controls how many sequences vLLM can process in a batch.

Higher values can improve throughput but may increase inter-token latency.

Good starting values:

```text
32, 64, 128
```

Internal dry run result: `32` was better than `64` for the streamed tutor workload.

### `--max-batch-tokens`

Controls the maximum total tokens in a scheduling batch.

Higher values can improve prefill throughput but may allow prefill work to interfere with decode responsiveness.

Good starting values:

```text
2048, 4096, 8192
```

Internal dry run result: `4096` was better than `8192` for the main workload.

### `--max-model-len`

Controls maximum context length. Higher values reserve more KV capacity.

For this assignment, use:

```text
8192
```

You can experiment with lower values if your prompt set fits, but do not reject official benchmark prompts.

### Prefix caching

Enable:

```bash
--prefix-cache
```

Disable:

```bash
--no-prefix-cache
```

Why it matters: every request shares the same InferTutor system prompt. vLLM can reuse KV blocks for repeated prefixes.

### Chunked prefill

Enable:

```bash
--chunked-prefill
```

Disable:

```bash
--no-chunked-prefill
```

Why it matters: mixed workloads include short questions, image requests, and long prompts. Chunked prefill prevents long prefills from monopolizing the scheduler.

### Eager vs compiled mode

Fast startup / eager mode:

```bash
--fast-boot
```

Compiled mode:

```bash
--no-fast-boot
```

Internal dry run:

- Compiled mode was excellent for text-only serving.
- Compiled mode was poor for mixed multimodal traffic in this setup.
- Eager mode was more reliable for image and mixed workloads.

## Approximate Modal Cost

Modal pricing changes over time, so check Modal's current GPU pricing before the workshop. For planning, assume an H100 costs roughly a few dollars per GPU-hour.

The rough formula is:

```text
Cost = GPU_count * runtime_hours * price_per_GPU_hour
```

Example estimates if H100 is around 4 USD per GPU-hour:

| Run | GPU count | Duration | Approx cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Smoke test | 1 | 5 minutes | about 0.33 USD |
| Single-GPU experiment | 1 | 10 minutes | about 0.67 USD |
| 4-GPU run | 4 | 10 minutes | about 2.67 USD |
| 8-GPU boss run | 8 | 10 minutes | about 5.33 USD |

Cold starts, model downloads, and compilation time count. Stop unused deployments after experiments.

Useful command:

```bash
modal app list
modal app stop <APP_ID_OR_NAME>
```

The starter runner deploys apps with a scale-down window, but you should still clean up after yourself.

## Reading Results

Each load test writes a JSON file under:

```text
results_infertutor/
```

Key fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ttft_p95_ms` | p95 time to first streamed content chunk |
| `itl_p95_ms` | p95 inter-token or inter-chunk latency |
| `latency_p95_ms` | p95 total request latency |
| `aggregate_stream_chunks_per_s` | aggregate streamed content chunks per second |
| `requests_per_s` | completed requests per second |
| `error_rate` | failed requests divided by total requests |

For final judging, your instructor may run the same endpoint with a hidden evaluator that computes exact token throughput and quality pass rate.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Run the smoke test.
2. Run the 1-GPU baseline.
3. Increase users until p95 TTFT bends.
4. Toggle prefix caching.
5. Toggle chunked prefill.
6. Try `max-seqs` and `max-batch-tokens` sweeps.
7. Add replicas.
8. Try compiled mode for text-only.
9. Pick your final run.
10. Stop Modal apps.
11. Write your engineering report.

## What Good Engineering Looks Like

Good submissions do not just show a high number. They explain the path:

- What bottleneck did you think you had?
- What metric supported that hypothesis?
- What knob did you change?
- What happened?
- Why did you keep or reject that configuration?

The goal is not magic. The goal is disciplined measurement.
